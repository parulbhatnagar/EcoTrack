**EcoTrack – Personal Environment Impact Tracker**

**Climate Challenge:**  
With global temperatures nearing the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C threshold and greenhouse gas concentrations at 150% of baseline, urgent climate action is critical. While policy and industry play major roles, individuals contribute daily through transportation, energy use, food choices, and waste. Yet, most lack accessible tools to measure and reduce their environmental footprint, slowing progress on SDG 13.2 (integrating climate measures) and 13.3 (awareness and education).

**Solution Overview:**  
EcoTrack is a mobile app empowering eco-conscious urbanites (18–45) to track and lower their environmental impact. Users log daily activities—commutes, meals, water use, waste—and receive an Impact Score across air (carbon emissions), water (usage/wastewater), and land (waste generation). Profiles (e.g., vehicle type, diet) personalize calculations, ensuring relevance across diverse urban settings.

**User Experience:**  
EcoTrack’s intuitive interface guides users through their “Green Journey.” After entering their profile and daily habits, users receive a real-time Impact Score. The “Weekly Eco Report” visualizes trends, while the “Green Actions & Offsets” section offers personalized, region-specific recommendations—like switching to public transit or composting—plus offset options such as reforestation. Gamified features, like earning “Green Points” and sharing achievements, boost engagement and social motivation.

**Unique AI Integration:**  
EcoTrack uniquely deploys IBM Watson with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in three steps:  
1. **Personalized Scoring:** Retrieves up-to-date emission factors and regional variables to calculate Impact Scores, adapting to local context (e.g., higher urban emissions).  
2. **Insightful Summaries:** Analyzes weekly user data to highlight trends and pinpoint causes of score changes.  
3. **Actionable Recommendations:** Pulls solutions from regional news, government reports, and sustainability databases, delivering practical, location-specific advice for improvement.

Unlike static calculators, EcoTrack’s AI continuously adapts to new data sources and user behavior, ensuring recommendations remain relevant and effective.

**Impact and Creativity:**  
By making climate impact tangible and actionable, EcoTrack directly advances SDG 13.2 and 13.3. Its AI-driven, gamified, and user-centric approach is unique in dynamically tailoring insights and recommendations to each user’s real-world context, driving sustained, collective climate action.
