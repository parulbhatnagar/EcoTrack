**RAG and IBM watsonx.ai Usage in EcoTrack**

EcoTrack employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM watsonx.ai, powered by the **IBM Granite-3.2-8B-Instruct** model, to assess users’ environmental impact and provide personalized recommendations, aligning with UN SDG 13’s climate action goals. For the Proof of Concept (PoC), tailored for a Bangalore user, RAG integrates diverse data sources with user inputs to deliver contextually relevant insights through a structured pipeline.

**Data Ingestion and Embedding:**  
The PoC begins by sourcing data from URLs, static documents, PDFs, and CSV files, as outlined in the GitHub documents for Impact Score and Green Actions & Offsets. These sources include emission factors (e.g., from the EPA), regional water usage stats (e.g., from Bangalore Urban Metabolism Project), and sustainability solutions (e.g., from BMRCL for transit options). While some sources require licenses and are slated for future use, the PoC uses a subset of accessible data. This data is loaded and processed to create embeddings using the IBM Slate 30M English model, a lightweight embedding model optimized for English text. **For the PoC, these embeddings are stored in memory for rapid prototyping and retrieval. In the main solution, embeddings will be stored in a scalable vector database within IBM Watson Discovery to enable efficient, persistent, and large-scale retrieval.**

**RAG Workflow:**  
The RAG pipeline operates in three steps. First, user data—like a Bangalore user’s 21 km commute in a gasoline Nissan Magnite, a beef meal, and a 6-minute shower—is combined with the embedded environmental data as context. For the Impact Score, RAG retrieves relevant embeddings (e.g., emission factors for gasoline vehicles, 2.3 kg CO2 per liter) to calculate impacts, ensuring scores are relative by factoring in regional variables like Bangalore’s urban density. Second, a weekly summary is generated by retrieving user activity trends and corresponding environmental data, highlighting factors like increased meat consumption affecting the score. Third, RAG retrieves green actions from sources like Bangalore-specific transit solutions to suggest improvements, such as adopting metro travel to reduce emissions.

**IBM watsonx.ai Querying with Granite-3.2-8B-Instruct:**  
IBM watsonx.ai leverages the **Granite-3.2-8B-Instruct** model—an 8-billion-parameter, long-context, instruction-tuned language model with advanced reasoning and summarization capabilities. This model queries the retrieved context to generate actionable outputs. For instance, after retrieving data on Bangalore’s water scarcity, Granite-3.2-8B-Instruct might suggest: “Shorten your 6-minute shower to 4 minutes to save 20 liters daily.” The model ensures suggestions are practical and localized, drawing from the embedded data to recommend offsets like supporting regional reforestation initiatives. This integration of RAG with watsonx.ai and Granite-3.2-8B-Instruct ensures EcoTrack delivers precise, region-specific recommendations, supporting SDG 13.2 (integrating climate measures) and 13.3 (raising awareness) by empowering users with tailored climate actions.
