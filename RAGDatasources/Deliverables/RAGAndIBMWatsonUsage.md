**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM watsonx.ai Usage in EcoTrack**

EcoTrack leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM watsonx.ai to deliver precise, context-aware environmental impact assessments and actionable recommendations for users. RAG is central to our solution, as it enables the AI to dynamically retrieve and integrate the most relevant, up-to-date information from diverse sources—such as emission factor databases, regional environmental reports, and sustainability guidelines—directly into the generative process. This approach ensures that user-facing outputs are grounded in verifiable data, significantly reducing the risk of hallucinations and enhancing trustworthiness.

**Technical Workflow:**  
- **Data Ingestion & Embedding:** EcoTrack ingests structured and unstructured data (e.g., PDFs, CSVs, web articles) covering emission factors, local water usage, and green actions. Using the IBM Slate 30M English model, we generate embeddings for this content and store them in a vector database within IBM Watson Discovery, enabling rapid semantic retrieval.
- **RAG Pipeline:**  
  1. **Impact Calculation:** When a user logs daily activities, RAG retrieves pertinent data (e.g., Bangalore-specific emission factors, water scarcity indices) to calculate an Impact Score that reflects both global standards and local realities.
  2. **Trend Analysis:** For weekly summaries, RAG pulls historical activity data and relevant environmental benchmarks, allowing watsonx.ai to generate concise, personalized feedback on the user’s progress.
  3. **Personalized Recommendations:** RAG retrieves region- and activity-specific solutions (e.g., local transit options, water-saving tips), enabling watsonx.ai to suggest targeted, practical actions for improvement.

IBM watsonx.ai’s advanced LLM then synthesizes these retrieved contexts, generating outputs that are not only accurate but also tailored to the user’s location and behavior. For example, after analyzing Bangalore’s water scarcity data and a user’s shower habits, watsonx.ai might recommend shorter showers and provide quantifiable savings, all grounded in authoritative local data.

**Innovation:**  
This integrated RAG + watsonx.ai approach is novel in the environmental impact space. Unlike static calculators, EcoTrack’s AI dynamically adapts to new data sources and evolving local conditions, ensuring recommendations remain relevant and actionable. By bridging complex environmental data with user-friendly, personalized guidance, EcoTrack empowers individuals to make informed climate decisions—supporting SDG 13.2 and 13.3 in a way that is both scalable and uniquely adaptive.
