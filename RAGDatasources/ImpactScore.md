### **How to Use These Sources for RAG**

- **Retrieve**: Use these URLs to download or query datasets for emission factors, usage norms, and quality indices.
- **Augment**: Index the documents or data in your RAG retrieval system (Watson Discovery, etc.).
- **Generate**: Use the retrieved data to calculate, contextualize, and explain the impact score for a user’s daily habits.
