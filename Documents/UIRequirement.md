### Proposed UI Screens

The five screens form a logical flow: user setup (profile), data input (daily activities), impact visualization (score), summary, and actionable recommendations. Here’s an analysis of each screen’s clarity and suggestions for improvement:

1. **User Profile Screen**
   - **Purpose**: Captures one-time data (e.g., commute distance, food habits) to establish a baseline environmental footprint.
   - **Clarity**: Clean, as it focuses on static user data and environmental preferences. Ensure fields are intuitive and grouped logically (e.g., personal info, commute, lifestyle).
   - **Suggestions**:
     - Use a step-by-step wizard or accordion layout to avoid overwhelming users with too many fields at once.
     - Include tooltips or examples for complex inputs (e.g., “Estimate your commute distance in kilometers”).
     - Add a progress indicator to show completion percentage for motivation.
     - Ensure accessibility (e.g., high-contrast text, screen reader compatibility).

2. **User Daily Input Screen**
   - **Purpose**: Collects real-time activity data (e.g., travel, food orders) with profile data as a fallback.
   - **Clarity**: Focused and functional. The distinction between actual and generic inputs is clear, but the interface must be quick and non-intrusive to encourage daily use.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - Use a card-based or checklist layout for quick activity selection (e.g., “Drove to office,” “Ordered takeout”).
     - Implement autofill or suggestions based on past inputs or profile data to reduce effort.
     - Add a “quick log” option for users to confirm default activities (e.g., “Same as yesterday”).
     - Include a calendar view to allow retroactive edits for missed days.

3. **Impact Assessment Score Screen**
   - **Purpose**: Displays a daily environmental impact score (out of 100) with a graph for progress tracking, powered by RAG and local environmental data.
   - **Clarity**: Clear and engaging, especially with the graph for visualizing progress. The RAG integration ensures personalized scores.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - Use a bold, central score display (e.g., a circular progress bar) with color coding (green for low impact, red for high).
     - Include a breakdown of contributors (e.g., 40% transport, 30% food) for transparency.
     - Ensure the graph is interactive (e.g., zoomable timeline for weekly/monthly views).
     - Add a “Learn More” link to explain how the score is calculated, enhancing trust.

4. **Summary Screen**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a textual RAG-generated summary of the user’s impact based on profile and daily inputs.
   - **Clarity**: Straightforward, but risks being redundant with the score screen unless it offers unique insights.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - Use concise, bullet-point summaries with actionable insights (e.g., “Your food orders increased your footprint by 10% this week”).
     - Highlight trends or anomalies (e.g., “Your travel impact spiked due to a long trip”).
     - Allow users to share summaries (e.g., via social media or PDF export) to promote community engagement.
     - Integrate a tone that’s encouraging, not judgmental, to maintain motivation.

5. **Actionable Suggestion Screen**
   - **Purpose**: Delivers RAG-powered, personalized recommendations to reduce environmental impact.
   - **Clarity**: Clean and critical for user engagement. The RAG integration ensures relevance.
   - **Suggestions**:
     - Present suggestions as prioritized cards (e.g., “Switch to public transport: 15% impact reduction”).
     - Include a “commit” button for users to pledge actions, with reminders or notifications.
     - Link to external resources (e.g., carbon offset programs) for immediate action.
     - Add a gamification element, like earning badges for completing suggestions.

**Overall Interface Cleanliness**: The flow is intuitive, starting with setup, moving to data input, and culminating in insights and actions. To maintain a clean UI:
- Use a consistent design system (e.g., Material Design or IBM’s Carbon Design) for uniformity.
- Minimize navigation steps (e.g., a bottom navigation bar for quick access to all screens).
- Ensure mobile-first design, as many users (especially in India) will access via smartphones.
- Avoid clutter by limiting each screen to 3-5 key elements (e.g., input fields, visuals, buttons).

### Suggested Questionnaire for User Profile and Daily Input

Based on the problem statement’s focus on water, air, and land impacts, here are tailored questions for the **User Profile** (point 1) and **User Daily Input** (point 2). These aim to capture comprehensive data while being user-friendly, especially for your target audience (25-45-year-olds, corporate employees, students).

#### User Profile Questionnaire (One-Time Setup)
This gathers baseline data for commute, food, energy, and lifestyle. Keep it concise to avoid user drop-off.

1. **Personal Information**
   - Name (optional for privacy)
   - Age range (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+)
   - Location (city or postal code for local environmental factors, e.g., urban vs. rural India)
   - Household size (number of people sharing resources)

2. **Commute Details**
   - Primary mode of transport to work/school (e.g., car, bike, public transport, walking)
   - One-way commute distance (km)
   - Commute frequency (days per week)
   - Vehicle type, if applicable (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric; engine size)

3. **Food and Consumption Habits**
   - Dietary preference (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan)
   - Frequency of food delivery/takeout (times per week)
   - Average weekly grocery consumption (e.g., packaged vs. fresh produce)
   - Water usage habits (e.g., bottled water usage, liters per day)

4. **Energy and Waste**
   - Primary energy source for home (e.g., electricity, gas, solar)
   - Average monthly electricity usage (kWh, if known, or estimate via appliances)
   - Waste habits (e.g., percentage of waste recycled, composted, or landfilled)
   - Use of single-use plastics (e.g., daily, weekly, rarely)

5. **Lifestyle and Preferences**
   - Frequency of non-commute travel (e.g., flights, road trips per month)
   - Use of eco-friendly products (e.g., reusable bags, low-energy appliances)
   - Participation in environmental initiatives (e.g., tree planting, cleanups)
   - Preferred offset programs (e.g., carbon credits, local projects)

**Tips**:
- Use dropdowns or sliders for quick input (e.g., “How often do you order food? 0-1, 2-3, 4+ times/week”).
- Allow users to skip non-essential questions with defaults based on regional averages (e.g., India’s average commute distance).
- Include a “review and update” option for periodic profile updates.

#### User Daily Input Questionnaire (Daily Logging)
This captures real-time activities with minimal effort, defaulting to profile data if skipped.

1. **Travel**
   - Did you travel to work/school today? (Yes/No; default to profile commute)
   - Mode of transport (e.g., car, bus, bike; pre-fill from profile)
   - Total distance traveled (km; auto-calculate for commute or allow manual entry)
   - Additional trips (e.g., “Went to movies: 5 km by car”)

2. **Food**
   - Did you order food delivery/takeout? (Yes/No; specify type, e.g., vegetarian pizza)
   - Home-cooked meal ingredients (e.g., packaged, fresh, meat-based)
   - Bottled water or beverage consumption (liters or units)

3. **Energy and Waste**
   - Unusual energy usage (e.g., “Ran AC for 5 hours”)
   - Waste generated (e.g., “2 plastic bottles,” “1 kg food waste”)
   - Recycling or composting actions (e.g., “Recycled paper,” “Composted scraps”)

4. **Other Activities**
   - Non-routine activities (e.g., “Flew 500 km,” “Bought new electronics”)
   - Eco-friendly actions (e.g., “Used reusable bag,” “Planted a tree”)

**Tips**:
- Use a checklist or toggle format for quick logging (e.g., tap to confirm “Commute as usual”).
- Integrate location-based prompts (e.g., detect travel via GPS and suggest logging).
- Allow voice or photo input (e.g., snap a food package to log waste) for tech-savvy users.
- Send daily reminders (e.g., push notifications) to encourage consistent logging.

### Suggestions for Additional Screens

To enhance EcoTrack’s functionality and engagement, aligning with the problem statement’s focus on behavioral change and community features, consider these additional screens:

1. **Community Hub Screen**
