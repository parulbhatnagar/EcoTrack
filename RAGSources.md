### Notes on Data Sources
- **Access Considerations**: Some sources (e.g., The Lancet, ScienceDirect) may require subscriptions or institutional access. Check for open-access versions or contact organizations (e.g., IISc) for datasets.
- **Bengaluru-Specificity**: National sources (e.g., NSSO, FAO) need filtering for Karnataka/Bengaluru. Local sources (e.g., BWSSB, BBMP) provide direct city-level data.
- **Dynamic Data**: APIs like Climatiq offer real-time emission factors, while X posts provide current trends (e.g., water scarcity discussions). Schedule periodic scraping for updates.
- **Data Formats**: Sources provide data in HTML, PDFs, CSVs, or APIs. Use tools like `BeautifulSoup`, `pdfplumber`, or API clients to extract and structure data.
- **Verification**: Cross-check data (e.g., KSPCB emission factors with CSE reports) to ensure accuracy, especially for user-generated content on X.

### Structuring for RAG
To integrate these sources into a RAG system:
- **Structured Data**: Convert numerical data (e.g., emission factors, water use) into JSON/CSV formats. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "activity": "two-wheeler commute",
    "metric": "emission_factor",
    "value": 0.05,
    "unit": "kg CO2/km",
    "source": "KSPCB",
    "url": "https://kspcb.karnataka.gov.in/",
    "location": "Bengaluru"
  }
  ```
- **Unstructured Data**: Include reports, articles, or X posts for qualitative insights, processed via NLP tools (`nltk`, `spacy`).
- **Embedding**: Use `sentence-transformers` to create embeddings for retrieval, stored in `FAISS` or `Pinecone`.
- **Retrieval**: Match user queries (e.g., “Impact of 10-km commute in Bengaluru”) to relevant data using vector similarity.
- **Generation**: Use an LLM (e.g., via xAI API: [https://x.ai/api](https://x.ai/api)) to produce responses like “Your 10-km two-wheeler commute emits 0.5 kg CO2/day (KSPCB).”
